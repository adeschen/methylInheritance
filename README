Conserved Differentially Methylated Elements from One Generation
to the Next: Inheritance versus Randomness
================================================================

Authors

Astrid Deschenes, Pascal Belleau and Arnaud Droit


Description
-----------

The methylInheritance package implements a permutation analysis,
based on Monte Carlo sampling, for testing the hypothesis that
the number of conserved differentially methylated elements,
between several generations, is associated to an effect inherited
from a treatment and that stochastic effect can be dismissed.

The methylInheritance package is an official package of
Bioconductor.


Installation
------------

We strongly suggest to install the methylInheritance package
through Bioconductor:

http://bioconductor.org/packages/methylInheritance/

However, it is also possible to install the current github
version, through the help of the CRAN devtools package.

library(devtools)
install_github("adeschen/methylInheritance")

In addition, older versions of the package are available on
GitHub:

https://github.com/adeschen/methylInheritance/releases


Description of Package Functionality
------------------------------------

The vignette of the methylInheritance package, which is a
document that provides a task-oriented description of the package
functionality, is available on Bioconductor website:
