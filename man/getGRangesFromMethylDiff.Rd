\title{Transform results from a CpG site or region analysis done on mutliple
generations into a \code{list} of \code{GRanges} objects}
\usage{
getGRangesFromMethylDiff(methDiff, pDiff, qvalue, type = c("all", "hyper",
  "hypo"))
}
\arguments{
\item{methDiff}{a \code{list} of S4 \code{methylDiff} class objects, each
entry of the \code{list} represents the differentially methylated results
for one generation (first entry = first genertation, second entry =
second generation, etc..). Each \code{methylDiff} object holds statistics
and locations
for differentially methylated regions/bases.}

\item{pDiff}{a positive \code{double} between \code{0} and \code{100},
the cutoff for absolute value of methylation percentage change
between test and control.}

\item{qvalue}{a positive \code{double} inferior to \code{1}, the cutoff
for qvalue of differential methylation statistic.}

\item{type}{One of the \code{"hyper"},\code{"hypo"} or \code{"all"} strings,
the string specifies what type of differentially methylated bases/tiles
should be treated  For
retrieving hyper-methylated tiles/sites \code{type} = \code{"hyper"}; for
hypo-methylated \code{type} = \code{"hypo"}. Default: \code{"all"}.}
}
\value{
a \code{list} of \code{GRanges} objects, each
entry of the \code{list} represents the differentially methylated results
for one generation (first entry = first genertation, second entry =
second generation, etc..). Each \code{GRanges} object holds statistics
for differentially methylated regions/bases.
}
\description{
Transform a \code{list} of \code{methylDiff} objects into
a \code{list} of \code{GRanges} objects. Each \code{methylDiff} object
represent a CpG site or region analysis done on one generation.

\examples{

## Load permutation results on sites
permutationResultsFile <- dir(system.file("extdata",
    package = "methylInheritance"),
    pattern = "permutationResultsForSites.RDS", full.names = TRUE)
permutationResults <- readRDS(permutationResultsFile)

## Transform result to GRanges
resultsGR <- methylInheritance:::getGRangesFromMethylDiff(methDiff =
    permutationResults, pDiff = 10, qvalue = 0.01, type = "hyper")
