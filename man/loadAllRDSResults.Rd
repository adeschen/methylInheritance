\description{
Load all RDS files created by the permutation and
observation analysis. The function
returns an object of \code{class} "methylInheritanceAllResults" that holds
all the pertinent information.
}
\examples{

## Get the name of the directory where files are stored
filesDir <- dir(system.file("extdata", package = "methylInheritance"),
    pattern = "TEST", full.names = TRUE)

## Load information from files
results <- loadAllRDSResults(analysisResultsDir = filesDir,
    permutationResultsDir = filesDir, doingSites = TRUE, doingTiles = TRUE)
