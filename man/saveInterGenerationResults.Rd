\title{Save the result of on CpG site or tile analysis on all generations.
The anaysis can come from observed or permutated dataset. Each case is
saved with a different extension.}
\usage{
saveInterGenerationResults(outputDir, permutationID, type = c("sites",
  "tiles"), interGenerationResult)
}
\arguments{
\item{outputDir}{a string, the name of the directory that will contain
the results of the permutation. The name should end with a slash. The
directory should already exists.}

\item{permutationID}{an \code{integer}, the identifiant of the permutation.
When the \code{permutationID} = \code{0}, the results are considered as the
observed results and are saved in a file with the "_observed_results.RDS"
extension. When the \code{permutationID} != \code{0}, the results are
considered as permutation results and are saved in a file with the
"_permutation_{permutationID}.RDS" extension.}

\item{type}{One of the \code{"sites"} or \code{"tiles"} strings. Specifies
the type
of differentially methylated elements should be returned. For
retrieving differentially methylated bases \code{type} =\code{"sites"}; for
differentially methylated regions \code{type} = \code{"tiles"}. Default:
\code{"both"}.}

\item{interGenerationResult}{a \code{list} that corresponds to the output
of the \code{interGeneration} function, the result of on CpG site or tile
analysis on all generations.}

\item{type}{One of the \code{"sites"} or \code{"tiles"} strings. Specifies
the type of differentially methylated elements should be saved.
Default: \code{"sites"}.}
}
\value{
\code{0} indicating that all parameters validations have been
successful.

\description{
Save the result of on CpG site or tile analysis on all
generations. The results are saved in a RDS file. The anaysis can come
from observed or permutated dataset.
Each case is saved with a different extension. The files containing the
permutation results have the permutation identifiant in their name.
}
\examples{

## Load a dataset
interGenerationResultFile <- dir(system.file("extdata",
package = "methylInheritance"), pattern = "interGenerationResult",
full.names = TRUE)
interGenerationResult <- readRDS(interGenerationResultFile)

## Save dataset
\dontrun{methylInheritance:::saveInterGenerationResults(
outputDir = "TEST", permutationID=100, type = "sites",
interGenerationResult = interGenerationResult)}
