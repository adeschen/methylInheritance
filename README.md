## Conserved Differentially Methylated Elements from One Generation to the Next: Inheritance versus Randomness


The **methylInheritance** package implements a permutation analysis, based 
on Monte Carlo sampling, for testing the 
hypothesis that the number of conserved differentially methylated 
elements, between several generations, is 
associated to an effect inherited from a treatment and that stochastic effect 
can be dismissed.
