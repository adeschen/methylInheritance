#' methylInheritance: Permutation-Based Analysis associating Conserved
#' Differentially Methylated Elements from One Generation to the Next to
#' a Treatment Effect
#'
#' This package does a permutation analysis, based on Monte Carlo sampling,
#' for testing the hypothesis that the number of conserved differentially
#' methylated elements (sites or tiles), between
#' several generations, is associated to an effect inherited from a treatment
#' and that stochastic effect can be dismissed.
